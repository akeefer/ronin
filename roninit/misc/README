Getting Started
===============

To create a new ronin application, you can either use the 'roninit' scripts provided
in this directory, or simply run:

  java -jar roninit_all.jar <path_to_my_app>

After you've created a Ronin application, you can start it up using Aardvark, which
can be downloaded from http://vark.github.com:

  cd <path_to_my_app>
  vark server

This will start an HTTP server up listening at

  http://localhost:8080

The development app server is Jetty, and the development database is H2
