Ronin is a Model/View/Controller-based web framework featuring full type safety. Links between pages in a Ronin application are checked at compile-time, which means no broken links - by using a modern IDE like Eclipse, you can catch configuration errors and regressions right away, saving you valuable testing and debugging time. And configuring a Ronin application is done purely with Gosu code - no magic and no XML files, which makes debugging easier.
